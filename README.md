# Task Manager - Ruby on Rails + PostgreSQL

This is the web version of my task manager, built using **Ruby on Rails** and **PostgreSQL**.

> âœ… **Important note:** This is my **first project using Ruby on Rails** and my **first experience with PostgreSQL connected to a web application.**  
This project was originally created as a terminal-based app and evolved into this web version.
